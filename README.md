The source code involved in Toba is only dependent on the standard libraries of the C language. The compilation performs both the on-the-fly calculation of constants and the construction of a machine code optimized for the portions of the program concerned by the fast algorithmic processing.  

In order to facilitate the learning of the language and to improve the speed of development, the builtins functions are carefully realized in order to obtain the minimum of input parameters while trying to cover the totality of the associated need. A single builtin function must be able to act on a maximum number of data types in order to be as versatile as possible and thus avoid endless searches in the documentation. A sufficient number of standardized internal functions will allow the developer to focus more on the goal than on how to achieve it.
